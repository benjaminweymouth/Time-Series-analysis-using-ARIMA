# Time Series: A Yen for the Future

### Introduction 
This repository holds 2 Jupyter notebooks and one csv file on  Time Series analysis for the A Yen for the Future exercises. The purpose of this code is to demonstrate understanding of time series work in Python: ARMA, ARIMA and related concepts.

## Background

The financial departments of large companies often have to make foreign currency transactions when doing international business, while hedge funds are also interested in anything that will provide an edge in predicting currency movements. Hence, both are always eager to gain a better understanding of the future direction and risk of various currencies. 

This repository uses time series analysis to predict future movements in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the Japanese yen.

Specifically, this repo reflects two core items:

1. Time series forecasting
2. Linear regression modelling
